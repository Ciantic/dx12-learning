# DX 12 learning stuff

Only thing useful for somebody else right now is stuff in [common library file](src/lib.rs). With that common library I've started a painful journey to convert [Microsoft's d3dx12.h](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/blob/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12HelloWorld/src/HelloTriangle/d3dx12.h) to Rust.

Everything considered written by me is licensed with MIT, some of the code is from other tutorials I have yet to document.
