# DX 12 learning stuff

Only thing useful for somebody else right now is stuff in [common library file](src/lib.rs). With that common library I've started a painful journey to convert [Microsoft's d3dx12.h](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/blob/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12HelloWorld/src/HelloTriangle/d3dx12.h) to Rust.

Everything considered written by me is licensed with MIT, some bits of the code is from other tutorials I have yet to document. Since most tutorials are written in C++, the code isn't pasted anywhere, I have translated relevant parts.

## Tutorials and materials used for the samples:

-   [Microsoft's DirectX 12 Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/blob/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12HelloWorld/)
-   [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1942270062)
-   [Braynzar Soft](https://www.braynzarsoft.net/viewtutorial/q16390-04-direct3d-12-drawing)
